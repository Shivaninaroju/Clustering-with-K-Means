# 🔹 K-Means Clustering — Internship Task

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering** using the Mall Customers dataset.  
It shows how to segment customers based on income and spending score.  

## ✅ Objectives
- Preprocess dataset & select clustering features  
- Apply **K-Means** clustering algorithm  
- Use **Elbow Method** to determine optimal clusters  
- Visualize clusters in 2D  
- Evaluate using **Silhouette Score**  

## 📊 Dataset
We use the **Mall Customers dataset**, containing information about customer income and spending behavior.  

## 🧪 Results
- Optimal K suggested by Elbow Method  
- Clusters segmented & visualized  
- Silhouette Score calculated for evaluation  

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.10+  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  

## 🚀 Purpose
Understand and apply **unsupervised learning (K-Means)** to real-world customer segmentation.
